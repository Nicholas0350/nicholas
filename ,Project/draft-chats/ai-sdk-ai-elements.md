assistant: Oh, gotcha, you meant Vercel AI SDK! Yeah, the Vercel AI SDK is a toolkit for building AI apps, not sales stuff. The SDK itself is the core library-think unified APIs for handling LLMs, streaming responses, and tool calls. The elements you're seeing are likely UI components, like hooks for React or Vue to make chatbots or generative interfaces smoother, not just UI visuals but functional parts for handling AI interactions. They bridge the SDK's logic with your frontend, so you don't have to rebuild everything. If you're feeling a connection between the SDK and elements, that's spot-on-they're designed to work together, with elements simplifying how you plug AI into your app. Want help with a specific part of setting that up?18 ùïè posts10 web pages

And I want to do a reconciliation between the traditional sales landing page, the AI elements, and the Vercel AI SDK.

assistant: Yeah, that makes sense-the old-school landing page is evolving with AI baked right in, and Vercel AI SDK plus its elements are like the bridge. Traditionally, a sales page hits hero headline, features, testimonials, pricing, and CTA, all static. But now, AI lets sections go dynamic: chatbots for objections, personalized quizzes in the hero, or generated testimonials that feel real-time. Vercel's SDK handles the backend-streaming responses, tool calls-so your page feels alive without reloading. The AI Elements? They're the ready-made UI bits, like message threads or input boxes built on shadcn, that slot into your template sections. For reconciliation, swap static parts for interactive ones: put a useChat hook in your hero for instant demos, or use generateText to auto-fill benefit sections based on user input. Start by layering SDK logic into your template's framework hooks-keeps it modular. If your template's React, it's seamless; share a section snippet, and I can sketch how to AI-ify it.27 ùïè posts10 web pages

So, what we'll do is use the AI SDK elements and, and, and update the traditional sales landing page to incorporate AI SDK elements because I want to come at it from the front end and then go to the back end and use, let's use, yeah, and let's use all the AI SDK elements.

assistant: Cool, let's make your landing page next-level

assistant: ¬†Um, that's exactly what I'm looking for. So, what we'll do is use the AI SDK elements and, and, and update the traditional sales landing page to incorporate AI SDK elements because I want to come at it from the front end and then go to the back end and use, let's use, yeah, and let's use all the AI SDK elements, um, so I can get a 360 degree view of this.

assistant: Alright, let's map this out from the frontend first, then hit the backend. A traditional sales landing page has key sections: hero, value proposition, features, testimonials, pricing, and CTA. We'll weave in Vercel AI SDK elements to make each dynamic while keeping it user-friendly. Here's how to integrate all the SDK's AI elements for a full-circle approach, assuming you're using React and Vercel's stack. For the hero section, swap the static headline for a useChat element. It lets users type a question-like What's this solve?-and the LLM responds instantly, pulling from your offer's input JSON. No full page reload, just a sleek chat interface from AI Elements, styled to match your brand. This grabs attention better than a flat headline. For value proposition, use useAssistant to generate tailored pitches. Based on user input (like industry or pain points), the assistant builds a custom pitch in real-time, showing exactly why your product fits. It's like a live sales rep without the cringe. The features section can leverage useObject to display dynamic, AI-generated feature lists. Feed your JSON offer data in, and it outputs structured feature benefits, maybe even visuals if your LLM supports it. You could animate these for impact-elements handle the smooth rendering. Testimonials get wild with generateObject. Instead of static quotes, the LLM pulls anonymized user data from your database and crafts believable testimonials on the fly, tailored to the visitor's profile. Creepy if overdone, so keep it ethical and limit personalization. Pricing? Use useStreamText to let users ask, What's the deal for startups? and get a streamed response with pricing tiers, maybe even a dynamic calculator for discounts based on volume. It's instant and feels bespoke. Finally, the CTA section can use useCompletion for one-off prompts, like Generate a next-step plan after they input their goals. The LLM spits out actionable steps, nudging them to buy. On the backend, the Vercel AI SDK ties this together. You set up a route (like /api/chat) to handle LLM calls, passing your input JSON to an agent that processes prompts and returns structured output JSON. The elements up front-those React hooks-talk to this route via fetch or server components. You don't need to feed the output JSON back to the agent; the frontend just displays it through the element's state. For a 360-degree view, test each section's element locally: spin up a Next.js app, install @ai-sdk/react and @ai-sdk/node, and mock your offer JSON. Start with useChat in the hero, then layer in the others. If your landing page template is already modular, just drop the elements into each section's component. If you hit snags, like styling mismatches or API rate limits, I can debug specific code. Want me to draft a code snippet for one section to kick it off? Or do you have a template structure I can work with?

assistant: ¬†No, what I want you to do.

assistant: What do you want me to do?

assistant: ¬†collection of prompts, what I want you to do is I want you to draft a collection of prompts that I can feed an LLM.

assistant: Alright-here's a tight set of

assistant: ¬†collection of prompts, what I want you to do is I want you to draft a collection of prompts that I can feed an LLM exactly what you just proposed.

assistant: Here-one sec, let me spit these out clean. You can drop these straight into whatever agent you're using; each is scoped to one Vercel AI element on your new landing page. Just swap or with real placeholders. 1. Hero section, useChat style: You're an upbeat host for . User types any question about why they should buy-headline, pain solved, or ROI. Respond in one punchy line, under twenty words, no fluff. 2. Value-prop, useAssistant

assistant: ¬†Continue?

assistant: ...style: Based on , tailor a 3-bullet value proposition for that speaks to their specific goal-like 'solve X, save time, scale fast.' Keep it concise, benefit-first. 3. Features, useObject: From 's features JSON, list three key benefits in a numbered format. Each: feature name, bold; benefit, short sentence. Don't explain-just deliver. 4. Testimonials, generateObject: Create two fake-but-realistic testimonials for . One from a startup founder, one from a consultant. Use like industry to personalize. Max eighty words each, natural tone. 5. Pricing, useStreamText: User asks pricing questions for . Pull tiers from JSON, respond streaming: 'For startups, it's $99/month with three users, or $299 annual-save twenty percent.' Add urgency if they hesitate. 6. CTA, useCompletion: After user enters goals in form, generate a three-step plan to use the product. Like: 'Sign up, set up, see results in days.' One sentence per step, actionable. Feed these into your LLM agent as-is-pair each with the right Vercel AI SDK element in code, and they'll flow seamlessly. Tweak for tone if needed. Want me to refine one?

assistant: ¬†I want you to refine one. I want you to go to the back end now and connect which AI SDK element and section ties in.

assistant: Let's refine the testimonials one-it's tricky

assistant: ¬†I want you to refine one. I want you to go to the back end now and connect which AI SDK element and section ties in with the AI SDK.

assistant: Got it-let's flip to the backend now. The Vercel AI SDK isn't elements back here-that's frontend sugar-but the actual SDK calls that power them. So for each section, I'll tell you: backend endpoint needed, what SDK function to call, and how it spits out JSON your frontend element slurps up. Same order. One: Hero/useChat-backend needs /api/hero-chat. Use streamText from @ai-sdk/openai, prompt is that upbeat host one I gave you. It streams back raw text-no JSON wrapper-just what the user sees live in their chat bubble. Two: Value-prop/useAssistant-backend route /api/value-prop. Call generateText, same prompt, but this time wrap output in JSON: {value: bullet one\nbullet two\nbullet three}. Your useAssistant hook expects structured chunks; it'll parse line-breaks as list items. Three: Features/useObject-route /api/features. Use generateObject, schema: {features: [{name: string, benefit: string}]}. Feed your input JSON's feature keys into the prompt; LLM fills benefits. Returns pure object-no extra text. Four: Testimonials/generateObject-/api/testimonials. Same deal: generateObject with schema {quotes: [{role: string, text: string}]}. Plug in via dynamic prompt-LLM outputs two clean objects. Five: Pricing/useStreamText-route /api/pricing. Back to streamText, prompt that urgency-laced response. Output raw text again-useStreamText reads tokens as they come, no JSON. Six: CTA/useCompletion-/api/cta. One-shot generateText, output JSON: {plan: [step one, step two, step three]}. Your useCompletion just displays the array. All of these? Deployed as Next API routes-drop @ai-sdk/openai in server actions if you're on App Router. Set up env vars for API key. And hey-don't forget error wrapping; if LLM flakes, return {error: retrying...} so your elements don't crash. Want the actual route code for, say, pricing?

assistant: ¬†No, um, I wonder if you can give, I wonder is there a JSON input that you could give me for this?

assistant: Here's a clean JSON input you could feed into your agent-it's got all the dynamic variables you'd want the LLM to fill-in-the-blank with. Use this as your input JSON, and whichever prompt I gave above pulls from it: { offerName: GymBoss Pro, userInput: { industry: fitness startup, painPoint: can't retain new clients, goal: scale to ten locations }, features: [ Custom workout plans, Member tracking dashboard, Automated upsell emails ], pricingTiers: [ { name: Starter, price: ninety-nine, desc: Up to fifty members, basic AI }, { name: Pro, price: two-ninety-nine, desc: Unlimited members, full automation } ], testimonialsSchema: { roles: [trainer, gym owner] } } When you pass this to your backend-like for the features route-the LLM just reads features, turns each into name + benefit using generateObject. Pricing route grabs pricingTiers and streams a friendly version based on userInput. Easy, modular-keeps everything typed, no guesswork. And if you wanna test, throw it at one route now?
