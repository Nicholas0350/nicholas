### Email Sequences (3 Complete Sequences)

#### Email 1: Problem Agitation
**Subject:** "Your compliance team is wasting 520 hours/year on this…"

**Body:**
"If your compliance officer is manually checking ASIC media releases, you're burning $120K/year in labor costs (10 hours/week × 52 weeks × $230/hour).

Worse? They're still missing critical enforcement actions because ASIC publishes updates across 6+ channels.

The entities who automate this stay 3 steps ahead. The ones who don't become the next $3.5M penalty case study.

Which one are you?"

**CTA:** "See how we automate 100% of ASIC monitoring in 24 hours"

---

#### Email 2: Solution Showcase
**Subject:** "How we found $300K in hidden penalty exposure in 14 days"

**Body:**
"Last month, a $50M AFSL came to us thinking they were fully compliant.

Our 14-day sprint uncovered:
- 3 unreported breach notifications (potential $500K penalty)
- 2 outdated AML/CTF policies (licence cancellation risk)
- 7 financial advisers with expired CPD certifications

Total penalty exposure: $300K+

Time to identify: 14 days (not 6 months)

Client effort required: 2 hours total

That's the power of automated ASIC intelligence."

Once spots are gone, the next window opens in Q2 2026 - at the higher price.

## RISK NOTES

1. **No Live Client Testimonials:** Using "beta client" language + data-backed proof instead of named case studies. **Risk:** Lower PLA without real testimonials. **Mitigation:** Lead with data monopoly + enforcement statistics.

2. **Capacity Constraint Verification:** 12 clients/quarter assumes sufficient fulfillment resources. **Risk:** Over-promise if delivery team can't scale. **Mitigation:** Deliberately conservative capacity claim.

3. **Guarantee Liability:** "Find 3 gaps or pay nothing" assumes high confidence in gap identification. **Risk:** Refund exposure if client is already compliant. **Mitigation:** Pre-qualify clients during assessment call.

4. **Price Increase Urgency:** April 1st price jump requires commitment to higher pricing. **Risk:** Credibility loss if prices don't actually increase. **Mitigation:** Document pricing change in public-facing policy.

5. **Regulatory Claims:** All penalty/enforcement statistics must be ASIC-sourced. **Risk:** Compliance violation if data is inaccurate. **Mitigation:** Cite sources for every claim (ASIC.gov.au, data.gov.au).
